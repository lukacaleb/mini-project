USING TERRAFORM TO CREATE MULTIPLE INFRASTRUCTURE ON AWS.
Using Terraform, to create several EC2 instances and put them behind an Elastic Load Balancer.
this project run terraform without a region.tfvars.
Making sure that after applying your plan, Terraform exports the public IP addresses of the instances to a file called host-inventory.
Get a .com.ng or any other domain name for yourself (be creative, this will be a domain you can keep using) 
and set it up with AWS Route53 within your terraform plan, 
then add an A record for subdomain terraform-test that points to your ELB IP address.
Create an Ansible script that uses the host-inventory file Terraform created to install Apache, 
set timezone to Africa/Lagos and displays a simple HTML page that displays content to clearly identify on all 3 EC2 instances.
